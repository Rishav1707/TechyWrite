## Adding a new opportunity to the list

Found a paid technical writing opportunity we don't have yet? You can easily add it using the following steps:

1. Go to the opportunities list JSON file:
   https://github.com/ashutoshkrris/TechyWrite/blob/master/src/data.json

2. Add an object to it as follows:

```json
  {
    "name": "Digital Ocean",
    "type": "Publication",
    "link": "https://www.digitalocean.com/community/pages/write-for-digitalocean",
    "categories": ["Infrastructure", "Open Source"],
    "minRate": 300,
    "maxRate": 400,
    "description": "Matches payments with donations to tech-focused charities. Further opportunities for paid updates to existing tutorials."
  }
```
* If there is fixed rate, then don't include `minRate`. Just include `maxRate`.
* If there is hourly rate, then use `hourlyMaxRate` instead of `minRate` and `maxRate`.
* If there is royalty, then use `royaltyRate` instead of `minRate` and `maxRate`.

3. Once done you can now raise a Pull Request to the main branch<br>
